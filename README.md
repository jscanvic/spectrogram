# Implementation details

The spectrogram is computed using the [Web Audio API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/) and more precisely using the [AnalyserNode](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/#AnalyserNode) interface. It is continuously rendered onto an [HTMLCanvasElement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#the-canvas-element). Every time a new section of the spectrogram is about to be rendered, everything else is shifted to the left before it is drawn on the newly available space. This is more computationally efficient than rendering the whole spectrogram at every frame and it enables real-time rendering at a higher temporal resolution.
